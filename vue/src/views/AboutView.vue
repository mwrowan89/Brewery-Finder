    <h1>What is a Brewery?</h1>
    <p>
      A brewery is a facility where beer is produced commercially. It's a place
      where various ingredients such as malted barley, hops, yeast, and water
      are combined and processed through brewing techniques to create different
      styles and flavors of beer. Breweries vary in size and scale, ranging from
      small craft breweries to large industrial operations.
